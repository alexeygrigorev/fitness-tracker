# Future-Proofing and Periodization

The system must allow future support for:
- Training blocks
- Volume and intensity phases
- Deload weeks
- Progressive overload analysis

This requires:
- Preset archiving
- Session independence from presets
- Aggregatable volume metrics

No dedicated periodization UI is required in v1.

# Product Overview

## Vision

Build a personal fitness and nutrition application that allows tracking, reconstruction, and understanding of physical activity, workouts, food intake, sleep, and recovery. The system connects exercises and food through a metabolism model and provides explainable, context-aware guidance. The app is goal-flexible and adapts as user goals change over time.

## Primary User

- Fitness-oriented individual
- Goals may vary over time (gain weight, lose weight, maintain, performance, health)
- Logs data in real time when possible, but often logs retrospectively
- Uses Garmin or similar devices for passive data
- Prefers low-friction, voice-based, and AI-assisted input

The system must not assume a single long-term goal or body recomposition focus.

# Time Handling and Editing

## Event Time vs Log Time

All items support:
- Event timestamp
- Log timestamp

Missing event times are inferred and marked as estimated.

## Retrospective Editing

Users can:
- Add missing workouts or meals
- Adjust timestamps
- Insert missed sets or activities

Estimated data is always labeled.
